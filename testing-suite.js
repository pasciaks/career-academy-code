// testing offers a way to ensure that your code is working as expected. It can also help you to identify bugs and errors in your code.
// conciseness, clarity, repeatability, and isolation



// expect(result).to.equal('HelloWorld');

// Mocking
// Mocking is the process of creating a fake version of an object or function that can be used to test the behavior of your code.
// Mocking is useful when you want to test a function that relies on another function that may not be available in your test environment.
// Mocking is also useful when you want to test a function that relies on a function that is not yet available in your test environment.

// Stubbing
// Stubbing is the process of creating a fake version of a function that can be used to test the behavior of your code.
// Stubbing is useful when you want to test a function that relies on another function that may not be available in your test environment.
// Stubbing is also useful when you want to test a function that relies on a function that is not yet available in your test environment.

// Spying
// Spying is the process of creating a fake version of a function that can be used to test the behavior of your code.
// Spying is useful when you want to test a function that relies on another function that may not be available in your test environment.
// Spying is also useful when you want to test a function that relies on a function that is not yet available in your test environment.

// Mocking, stubbing, and spying are all useful techniques for testing your code. They can help you to identify bugs and errors in your code.
// Snapshot testing is a technique for testing your code that involves taking a snapshot of the output of your code and comparing it to a previously saved snapshot.
// Snapshot testing is useful for testing your code that involves complex logic or that relies on external services.
